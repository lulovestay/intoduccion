<h3>Ivy</h3>

<p>How's one to know?<br>
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones<br>
In a faith forgotten land<br>
In from the snow<br>
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow<br>
Tarnished but so grand<p>

<p>And the old widow goes to the stone every day<br>
But I don't, I just sit here and wait<br>
Grieving for the living<p>

<p>Oh, goddamn<br>
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand<br>
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another<br>
Oh, I can't<br>
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland<br>
My house of stone, your ivy grows<br>
And now I'm covered in you<p>

<p>I wish to know<br>
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be<br>
Magnificently cursed<br>
He's in the room<br>
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see<br>
He wants what's only yours<p>

<p>Oh, goddamn<br>
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand<br>
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another<br>
Oh, I can't<br>
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland<br>
My house of stone, your ivy grows<br>
And now I'm covered<p>

<p>Clover blooms in the fields<br>
Spring breaks loose, the time is near<br>
What would he do if he found us out?<br>
Crescent moon, coast is clear<br>
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear<br>
He's gonna burn this house to the ground<p>

<p>How's one to know?<br>
I'd live and die for moments that we stole<br>
On begged and borrowed time<br>
So tell me to run<br>
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become<br>
And drink my husband's wine<p>

<p>Oh, goddamn<br>
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand<br>
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another<br>
Oh, I can't<br>
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland<br>
My house of stone, your ivy grows<br>
And now I'm covered in you<br>
And I'm covered in you<p>

<p>So yeah, it's a fire<br>
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark<br>
And you started it<br>
You started it<br>
So yeah, it's a war<br>
It's the goddamn fight of my life<br>
And you started it<br>
You started it<p>

<p>Oh, I can't<br>
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland<br>
My house of stone, your ivy grows<br>
And now I'm covered<br>
In you<br>
In you, you<br>
Now I'm covered in you<br>
In you<p>

<h3>Long Live</h3>
<hr>
<a name="c2">
<p><img src="longlive.jpeg"></p>
<p>I said remember this moment<br>
In the back of my mind<br>
The time we stood with our shaking hands<br>
The crowds in stands went wild<br>
We were the kings and the queens<br>
And they read off our names<br>
The night you danced like you knew our lives<br>
Would never be the same<br>
You held your head like a hero<br>
On a history book page<br>
It was the end of a decade<br>
But the start of an age<br>

<p>Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"<br>
And bring on all the pretenders<br>
One day we will be remembered<br>

<p>I said remember this feeling<br>
I passed the pictures around<br>
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines<br>
Wishing for right now<br>
We are the kings and the queens<br>
You traded your baseball cap for a crown<br>
When they gave us our trophies<br>
And we held them up for our town<br>
And the cynics were outraged<br>
Screaming, "This is absurd"<br>
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves<br>
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world<br>

<p>Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"<br>
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid<br>
Long live all the mountains we moved<br>
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you<br>
I was screaming, "Long live the look on your face"<br>
And bring on all the pretenders<br>
One day we will be remembered<br>

<p>Hold on to spinning around<br>
Confetti falls to the ground<br>
May these memories break our fall<br>

<p>Will you take a moment?<br>
Promise me this<br>
That you'll stand by me forever<br>
But if, God forbid, fate should step in<br>
And force us into a goodbye<br>
If you have children someday<br>
When they point to the pictures<br>
Please tell them my name<br>
Tell them how the crowds went wild<br>
Tell them how I hope they shine<br>

<p>Long live the walls we crashed through<br>
I had the time of my life with you<br>
Long, long live the walls we crashed through<br>
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you<br>
And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"<br>
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid<br>
Singing long live all the mountains we moved<br>
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you<br>
And long, long live the look on your face<br>
And bring on all the pretenders<br>
One day, we will be remembered<br>

<h3>Dancing With Our Hands Tied</h3>
<hr>
<a name="c3">
<p><img src="dwoht.jpg"></p>
<p>I, I loved you in secret<br>
First sight, yeah, we love without reason<br>
Oh, twenty-five years old<br>
Oh, how were you to know, and<br>
My, my love had been frozen<br>
Deep blue, but you painted me golden<br>
Oh, and you held me close<br>
Oh, how was I to know that<br>

<p>I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
I had a bad feeling<br>
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis<br>
People started talking, putting us through our paces<br>
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it<br>
I had a bad feeling<br>

<p>But we were dancing<br>
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
Like it was the first time, first time<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
And I had a bad feeling<br>
But we were dancing<br>

<p>I, I loved you in spite of<br>
Deep fears that the world would divide us<br>
So, baby, can we dance<br>
Oh, through an avalanche?<br>
And say, say that we got it<br>
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted<br>
Oh, 'cause it's gravity<br>
Oh, keeping you with me<br>

<p>I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets<br>
Picture of your face in an invisible locket<br>
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it<br>
I had a bad feeling<br>

<p>But we were dancing<br>
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
Like it was the first time, first time<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
(Ooh, we had our hands tied)<br>
And I had a bad feeling<br>
But we were dancing<br>

<p>I'd kiss you as the lights went out<br>
Swaying as the room burned down<br>
I'd hold you as the water rushes in<br>
If I could dance with you again<br>
I'd kiss you as the lights went out<br>
Swaying as the room burned down<br>
I'd hold you as the water rushes in<br>
If I could dance with you again<br>

<p>Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
Like it was the first time, first time<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied<br>
Yeah, we were dancing<br>
And I had a bad feeling<br>
But we were dancing<br>
Hands tied, hands tied<br>
